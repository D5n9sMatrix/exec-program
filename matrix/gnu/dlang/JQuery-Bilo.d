/*Another technique for array processing is to initialize the array to zeroes for numeric values, or to the
empty string or null string for character string entries (represented by two back-to-back quotation
marks ‘’ ). Then process the array starting at the beginning until you encounter an entry set to the ini-
tialization value. Here’s sample code that processes all elements of an array based on this approach:*/
void main(string path[])
{
    interface path
    {
        array_name. = "";
        /* initialize all array elements to some nonoccurring value */
        /*place elements into the array here */
        /*
         doThis code processes all elements in the array. */
         j = 1 while array_name.j <> ""
         say "Here's an array element:" array_name.j
         end
    }
